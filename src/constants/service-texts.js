  design: [
    'We develop the application’s design and architecture in compliance with the customer’s business goals and plans for the project’s evolution—to ensure sufficient scalability and performance as the solution matures. Depending on what a customer wants to achieve, we deliver a proof of concept, minimum viable product, or a production-grade app. ',
    'A Proof of Concept helps to validate whether the chosen architecture serves you business needs, identify weak aspects, and improve them. A Minimum Viable Product will help you to get early feedback from end users and justify feasibility. A Production-Grade App delivered in accordance with the 12-factor app principles, as well as best practices of microservice-based architecture and continuous integration / delivery. This approach allows for building competitive functionality to enter the market at a fast pace.'

  development: [
    'To ensure efficiency, we choose a development methodology that best fits your needs—either Agile or Kanban. We build a solution in accordance with the guidelines established at the previous stages: a clear set of expectations, a properly defined and tested architecture, and a delivery plan negotiated. During this stage, we do not only code and unit-test the application, but develop specifications and test plans.'
  ],
  maintenance: [
    'Establishing trusted, long-term relationships is top priority for us. We nourish our partnerships to keep the ball rolling even after the product is launched. You can always count on us for software maintenance and support, as well as further сustomization.',
    'We enable audit of the existing solutions to detect their weak points at any level (e.g., security, performance, etc.) and deliver recommendations for improvement. You can rely on us to address the issues identified or mitigate them by your own forces. Furthermore, we help you to develop new functionality, which brings even more business value, or migrate to a new, cloud-based technology stack once yours no longer satisfies your needs.'

  training: [
    'All our courses and training are built and taught by our engineers. The materials are based on our real world experience of building dozens of different applications and consulting to companies in diverse sectors.'
